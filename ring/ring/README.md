# Rings

## What is a Ring?

A ring is a set with the two operations of addition and
multiplication. The addition operation has an additive identity 0
such that a+0=a and, similarly, multiplication has a multiplicative
identity 1 such as a⋅1=a. Additional properties must hold, and they
will be discussed throughout the project. An example of rings is the
set of integer numbers with the regular addition and multiplication
operations. Another example is the set of real numbers with the
regular addition and multiplication operations. More exoteric rings
are also possible and will be discussed in future assignments. The
term “ring” is of uncertain origin. It is possibly due to the meaning
of ring as an association (a spy ring is a network of spies; a number
ring is a set of related numbers).

## How to compile and run

This project can be compiled and ran like any other Java project. Once compiled,
the program can be run.
